        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is <strong>Mary's classic lasagne</strong> recipe which has been perfected over the years. For the best results leave the lasagne to stand for <strong>6 hours before cooking</strong>. </p>
        <p>You can prepare this easy lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a busy week. Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>
